# Include your FlightSQL Grafana plugin here.
To connect Grafana to InfluxDB IOx, you will need to install the Grafana flighsql plugin. To do this follow these instructions [here](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud-iox/visualize-data/grafana/).

Once you have downloaded the plugin, unzip the folder and copy the `influxdata-flightsql-datasource` directory to the `plugins` directory in the top directory of this repository.
